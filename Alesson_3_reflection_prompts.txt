1. Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   A. You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local when you want to share your code
   with others.  Its also a good way to backup your code in case your machine fails.
2. Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   A. You might want to pull changes manually because you want to control which changes get introduced into your local repository.
